    <h1>Q: How can you change your name in Zoom?</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <video controls id="video">
            <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    </div>

    <h1 class="troubleshoot">Problems you might face</h1>
    <div class="container"><p> <SPAN class="problem">1: I am not logging in through a one-click link. </SPAN> <br>
<br>
        To change your name when you are not logging in through a one
        click link, simply navigate to the "Manage Participants" window,
        by either clicking on "Participants" in the toolbar located
        at the bottom of any Zoom meeting or using the keyboard shortcut
        (Ctrl + U).

        <br><br> Then find your name in the list of participants
        and hover over it. Then click on "More Options" and choose
        "Rename" from the drop down menu. You will be prompted
        to enter a different name. <br><br>

        If this doesn't work for you, it means that the host has not allowed
        participants to change their name. <br><br>

        But if you are still obstinate and want to change your name,
        press (Ctrl + I), and a window will pop open. Choose "Copy Invite Link"
        from the bottom of the window and leave the meeting. <br><br>

        Paste the link into the web browser, add the following and follow along as
        said in the video and you will be prompted to launch the meeting again.
        <br><br>

        Unfortunately, if you would not like to leave the meeting and join back
        again, or if the host has locked the meeting, there is no other way to
        do this, other than asking the host to rename you or asking the host
        to grant permission to allow participants to rename themselves.
